# Kitchen Calc - less 🧮, more 👨‍🍳 

No more mental kitchen math.

## Introduction
We've all faced the same problem while cooking: trying to convert a recipe that serves 4 to serve 6 (or 2, or 11) in our heads. Two and a quarter cups times 1.5, anyone?  
This web app makes it easy to multiply ingredient measurements for the right number of mouths.

## Usage
🖨️ Copy & paste a recipe's URL and input your desired servings. The app will automatically display the recipe's new ingredient list.

🍳 The final version of Kitchen Calc can be accessed at https://kitchen-calc.herokuapp.com/

📱 Yes, I'm mobile responsive!
