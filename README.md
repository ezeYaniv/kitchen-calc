## No more mental kitchen math!

We've all faced the same problem while cooking: trying to convert a recipe that serves 4 to serve 6 (or 2 or 11) in our heads. Two and a quarter cups times 1.5, anyone?

This web app makes it easy to multiply ingredient measurements for the right number of mouths: just copy & paste the recipe's URL and input your desired servings.
